Welcome to Student Support Hub, the ultimate platform designed to streamline communication between caseworkers and teachers, ensuring that every student's Individualized Education Program (IEP) or 504 plan is easily understood and consistently implemented. 

Student Support Hub is revolutionizing the way educational accommodations are communicated, fostering stronger collaboration between caseworkers and teachers, and ultimately enhancing the learning experience for students with IEP or 504 plans. Experience the power of simplified communication. 

This app is not in its final form, as there is quite a bit of safety measures that need to be implimented in order for a website like this to hold such sensitive information as legal documents like IEPs and 504s. In the future I plan to add a login function, as well as a whole new view of the website from a teacher's perspective.

## Features

### Simplified Accommodation Lists:
Caseworkers can effortlessly compile a comprehensive list of accommodations for each student, presented in a straightforward, bulleted format. This ensures that teachers can quickly grasp the unique needs of their students without getting overwhelmed by excessive information.

### Search and Filter Functions:  
Teachers can easily search for specific students or accommodations, streamlining their workflow and making it easier to find the information they need quickly.

### User-Friendly Interface: 
Student Support Hub is designed with simplicity in mind, making it easy for caseworkers of all levels of technical expertise to navigate and utilize effectively.
